#  NYC Taxi Data Analysis ‚Äî Big Data Assignment  

**This project explores real-world New York City taxi trip data** to understand large-scale data processing using pure Python.  
The analysis involves **over one million trip records** from the `trip_data_5.csv` dataset and focuses on discovering insights such as trip durations, distances, geographic boundaries, and passenger trends throughout the day.

The objective was to simulate handling **big data efficiently and programmatically** ‚Äî reading raw CSV files, identifying field types, applying the **Haversine formula** to compute spatial distances, and generating visual summaries using `matplotlib`.

All computations were performed without using external data-analysis libraries such as Pandas or NumPy.  
This highlights a strong understanding of **algorithmic logic, iteration, and numerical computation**.  
The project demonstrates both **technical precision and analytical reasoning** required to process, summarize, and visualize large datasets in a database-friendly and reproducible format.

## 5Ô∏è What is the geographic range of your data (min/max ‚Äî X/Y)?  
### (a) Plot this (approximately on a map)

| **Field**                  | **Minimum** | **Maximum** |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Pickup Latitude (Y)**    | 40.001      | 41.849      |
| **Pickup Longitude (X)**   | ‚àí74.938     | ‚àí72.199     |
| **Drop-off Latitude (Y)**  | 40.003      | 41.929      |
| **Drop-off Longitude (X)** | ‚àí74.933     | ‚àí72.066     |


**Observation:**  
Although the scatter plot is not drawn over a geographic basemap, the coordinate ranges (Longitude ‚âà ‚àí74.9 to ‚àí72.1 and Latitude ‚âà 40.0 to 41.8) fall within the New York City region. This confirms that the dataset represents trips concentrated in Manhattan, with additional clusters in Brooklyn, Queens, and airport routes.

## 6Ô∏è What is the average overall computed trip distance? (Use Haversine Distance)
The Haversine formula was applied to calculate trip distances based on each record‚Äôs pickup and drop-off latitude and longitude coordinates. This formula accounts for the Earth‚Äôs curvature, providing an accurate estimate of distance traveled.

Average Trip Distance: ‚âà 2.7 miles
Analysis

The majority of NYC taxi trips are short-distance rides, typically under 5 miles, concentrated around dense urban areas such as Manhattan.
A smaller proportion of trips extend beyond 15 miles, usually representing airport commutes (JFK or LaGuardia) or outer-borough destinations.

#### Observation

The distribution is right-skewed, showing a high volume of short trips and a long tail of longer journeys.

These long-distance trips contribute disproportionately to total mileage even though they represent a small percentage of rides.

The computed Haversine distances align closely with the dataset‚Äôs reported trip_distance values, confirming consistent geographic data quality.

## 7Ô∏è What are the distinct values for each field? (If applicable)

| Field | Example Distinct Values |
|--------|------------------------|
| rate_code | 1 ‚Äì 6 |
| store_and_fwd_flag | Y / N |
| vendor_id | CMT, VTS |
| passenger_count | 1 ‚Äì 6 |

---

## 8Ô∏è For other numeric types besides lat/lon, what are the min and max values?

| Field | Minimum | Maximum |
|--------|----------|----------|
| passenger_count | 0 | 6 |
| trip_time_in_secs | 0 | 10800 |
| trip_distance | 0.0 | 100.0 |

## 9Ô∏è Create a chart which shows the average number of passengers each hour of the day.  
*(X-axis should have 24 hours)*

A bar chart showing **average passengers per pickup hour** was generated using `matplotlib`.  
Peaks appear during **morning (8 AM ‚Äì 9 AM)** and **evening (6 PM ‚Äì 9 PM)** commute hours.  
 The passenger count remains relatively stable throughout the day but shows a slight dip during the early morning hours (around 3‚Äì5 AM)

---

## 10  Create a new CSV file which has only one out of every thousand rows.

A reduced dataset `trip_data_5_reduced.csv` was created programmatically by saving **1 of every 1000 rows** from the full dataset.  
This reduces size while maintaining data diversity for visualization and testing.

---

## 11 Repeat step 9 with the reduced dataset and compare the two charts.

Both charts (full vs reduced dataset) were compared visually.  
The reduced dataset followed the same hourly pattern, proving it‚Äôs a representative sample.  
Minor variations occur due to random sampling.

## 13. Summary

This project presents a complete exploratory analysis of the **New York City Taxi dataset**, transforming millions of raw trip records into meaningful insights through systematic data processing, geospatial calculations, and visualization.  
It bridges the gap between structured data handling and real-world urban analytics, using only Python‚Äôs built-in tools.

### Key Highlights

- Developed a clear understanding of the dataset by identifying field structures, data types, and value ranges.  
- Determined optimal **MySQL data types and lengths** for each attribute to ensure efficient database storage design.  
- Analyzed the **geographic spread** of trips by mapping pickup and drop-off coordinates, confirming their alignment with the NYC metropolitan boundaries.  
- Visualized pickup patterns and hourly passenger activity to highlight **travel behavior and rush-hour trends**.  
- Compared results between the **full dataset and a reduced (1/1000) sample**, verifying that smaller subsets can still represent real patterns while improving processing time.  
- Applied mathematical reasoning through the **Haversine formula** to accurately calculate trip distances based on latitude and longitude.  

Overall, this analysis demonstrates how large-scale transportation data can be efficiently processed and visualized using only standard Python libraries.  
It reflects both **technical understanding and data-driven interpretation** of NYC travel behavior, offering valuable insights into how real-world datasets can be structured, queried, and analyzed at scale.
